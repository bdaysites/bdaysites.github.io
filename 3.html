            <p>happy 20. ive been 20 for almost 3 months now so as someone older and wiser im gonna share my worldview.
                life is so deeply unserious. nothing matters unless u let it. nothing sticks unless you choose it. you don't have
                control over what happens, but you can choose how to respond. and life is about responding. life is about recalibrating
                in the face of something ugly. but life is mostly about people which sucks because people either leave you or disappoint you or die. 
                but we still keep choosing people, looking for people, waiting for people. because they might have the power to hurt you, sure,
                but people also have the power to help you make this life of yours beautiful, more bearable, more convenient. i want you to be healthy and happy,
                i want you to achieve everything you deserve and work so hard towards and i want us to be people in each other's lives, making 
                everything more bearable for a long time to come. happy birthday.
